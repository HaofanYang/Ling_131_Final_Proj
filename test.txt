Assignment 0++

Hello,

Here is assignment 0++, it is due Tuesday 18th but you do not need to hand it in since it is really only a check that you can do this.

Do the following:

1. Install Git

2. Open a GitHub account

3. Create a repository, version 1

Create repository on GitHub
Clone it to your local disk
Make changes on local disk and push up the changes
4. Create a repository, version 2

Create a local repository with some content
Create an empty repository on GitHub
Connect your local repository to the one on GitHub
Push all content from local repository to GitHub repository
After Tuesday, and if we haven't heard from you, we will assume you can do this.

Enjoy,
Marc
